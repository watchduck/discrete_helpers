# representatives (fast)

The methods here are currently without much practical significance.

The main goal is to easily find a clan representative for each Boolean function.

[faction_luckyrep](faction_luckyrep) and [family_luckyrep](family_luckyrep) can not be combined to get the clan representative.

[clan_malerep](clan_malerep) works only for male Boolean functions.
