# representatives (fast)

The methods here are currently without much practical significance.

The main goal is to easily find a clan representative for each Boolean function.

[`faction_luckyrep`](faction_luckyrep) and [`family_luckyrep`](family_luckyrep) can not be combined to get the clan representative.

[`clan_sharprep`](clan_sharprep) works only for sharp Boolean functions.
