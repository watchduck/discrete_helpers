# family representative for sharp functions

Sharp Boolean functions have a short truth table with odd weight.<br>
Calculating their representative is easy,<br>
because the functions in the family have all possible [binary Walsh spectra](../../../../methods/consul).<br>
The function where it has only zeros is chosen as representative.
