# representatives of equivalence classes

There are three types of equivalence classes:

* negation EC (families)
* permutation EC (factions)
* NP EC (clans)

There are different approaches to find a unique representative for each:

* _male_ is fast, but works only for male Boolean functions (whose roots have odd weight).
* _min_ is the smallest Zhegalkin index. This is currently the most promising approach.

## TL;DR

* The [fast](fast) approaches are experimental.
* The [minimal](minimal) approach is what works.
