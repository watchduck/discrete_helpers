# Walsh distances

Hamming distances of the truth table to the rows of a Walsh matrix

The nonlinearity can be derived from this.<br>
It is either the minimum, or the difference of length and maximum,
depending on which is smaller.<br>
E.g. if the length is 8 and the maximum is 7, then the nonlinearity is 1.

Apparently the pattern of bigger and smaller numbers corresponds to the pattern of signs in the [Walsh spectrum](../walsh_spectrum).
