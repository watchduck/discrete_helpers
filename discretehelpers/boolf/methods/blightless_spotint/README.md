This is an extension of [`bloatless_spotint`](../bloatless_spotint).
It takes that integer and removes the binary digits that do not correspond to elements of 
[`blightless_atomkeys`](../../properties/blightless_atomkeys).

The example *bitada* used in the test can be found
[here](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Studies_of_Euler_diagrams/gapspots/basiga#with_one-sided_splits).
