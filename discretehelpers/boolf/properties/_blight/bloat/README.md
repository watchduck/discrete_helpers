The `bloat` of a `Boolf` is a `SetPartComp` showing which of 
its arguments (`atomsvals`) are connected, i.e. equal or complementary.
(Its attributes are `equal_part` and `comp_pairs`.)
  
The method `related_part()` gives a `SetPart` of elements that are connected.

The integers used are not the `atomvals` of the `Boolf`, but their keys.
